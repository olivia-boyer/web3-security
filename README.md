# CS383: Web3 Security

## Course Description

This course will provide a technical introduction to Web3 from the lens of application level security. It will explore the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains through foundational computer science topics including cryptography and distributed systems. Students will gain hands on experience both developing applications on the Ethereum blockchain in the Solidity programming language and auditing them for correctness.

## Learning Goals

By the end of the course, students will be able to design, implement, test, and deploy smart contracts; analyze smart contract code for security vulnerabilities; use tools such as etherscan to investigate on-chain activity and transactions; and demonstrate familiarity with core blockchain concepts including cryptography and consensus algorithms.
